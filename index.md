mahmoud.parham@univie.ac.at

I received my PhD from the University of Vienna (2022), Austria ([thesis](https://github.com/maparham/maparham.github.io.git)).
I was honored to me a member of the [research group Communication Technologies](https://ct.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/102452/) headed by [Prof. Stefan Schmid](https://www.univie.ac.at/ct/stefan/).
My research interests are thematically around concepts of software-defined networking and network function virtualization.
I enjoy problem solving, devising algorithms, and proving properties formally. As of now, I'm a research and developer at [Salzburg Research](https://www.salzburgresearch.at).

## Industary Experience

- I have coded in C[++][11], Java, Javascript, Python, and typical web development and scripting languages.
- I worked at a German startup in Berlin, [Doc Cirrus](https://www.doc-cirrus.com) (2013--2015) as a backend developer (more of full stack). I was involved in the develpment of their core backend functions on NodeJS.
- I had numerous programming jobs back in home country as a passion and means of subsistence while studying (2002--2013).
