# Mahmoud Parham

mahmoud.parham@univie.ac.at

I'm a doctoral candidate at the University of Vienna, Austria, and a member of the [research group Communication Technologies](https://ct.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/102452/) headed by [Prof. Stefan Schmid](https://www.univie.ac.at/ct/stefan/).
My research interest are thematically around concepts of software-defined networking and network function virtualization.
I enjoy systematic problem solving, design of algorithms and proving properties formally.
